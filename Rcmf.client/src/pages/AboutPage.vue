                <p>Coos Bay Fire Department
                  A career firefighter, Captain Randy E. Carpenter, 46, died November 25, 2002, when the burning roof of
                  a
                  business in
                  downtown Coos Bay collapsed. Randy had been a firefighter for a total of 23 years. He began his career
                  as
                  a volunteer,
                  and later became a full-time firefighter with Baker City Fire Department. In February 1989, he
                  accepted
                  a
                  position with
                  Coos Bay Fire Department and his dedication there truly established his legacy. He was Baker City's
                  1983
                  'Firefighter of
                  the Year', and Coos Bay's 1991 'Firefighter of the Year'. He was also Coos Bay"s 1999 'EMT of the
                  Year'.
                  Randy's interest in firefighting began early in his life when he would accompany his father, a
                  volunteer
                  firefighter for
                  Baker City for 46 years, to the firestation. During the time he was a volunteer, Randy was very active
                  in
                  the Oregon
                  Volunteer Firefighter Association and served in all State Association offices, including president.
                  Randy
                  was a
                  consummate professional and was highly qualified in all operational and procedural aspects of his job.
                  He
                  was part of
                  the original efforts to bring a hazardous materials unit to Coos Bay and was a specialist in HAZMAT.
                  He
                  was qualified
                  and certified to teach all subjects of firefighting and regularly taught courses in CPR and EMT Basic
                  at
                  the local
                  college in Coos Bay. He took great pride in his job and treasured the trust and respect of all his
                  firefighter brethren.
                  He was an active member of the International Association of Firefighters, IAFF, Local 2935 (serving as
                  President in
                  1991), and the Regional Hazardous Materials Team. He was also skilled in construction and built a
                  successful contracting
                  business with his good friend Jim Bush.
                  The love of family was very foremost in Randy's life. He was so proud of and totally dedicated to his
                  two
                  girls, Sarah
                  and Stephanie, with priority in providing for their needs. His parents, Wayne and Dru, three brothers,
                  Kerry, Brad, and
                  Jeff, their spouses and families also survived him.
                  Randy was usually very successful when he took his boat out "crabbing", and was always happy when he
                  could
                  take time to
                  go water-skiing, at which he was very adept. He especially loved spending time in Eastern Oregon (Dad
                  &
                  Mom referred to
                  him as their "homing pigeon") where he would hunt deer, elk, and antelope, along with working with
                  longtime friends on
                  the Bunch Ranch near Durkee. While Randy had a wonderful sense of humor and enjoyed playing a
                  practical
                  joke, he never
                  wanted the limelight, just a way to be of help. His honesty and integrity were unquestionable. All his
                  family and his
                  countless friends, who were like family to him, will miss Randy beyond description.
                  The Randy Carpenter Memorial Firefighter Training Fund has been established to provide funds to aid in
                  needed training
                  for Oregon and Southwest Idaho firefighters and emergency personnel.</p>
